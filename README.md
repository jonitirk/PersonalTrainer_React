## Application description:

This is a React application implemented in a Node.js environment, designed to assist a fictional Personal Trainer in managing client information and their training details. The application retrieves client information from a database using a REST API and displays their booked training details on a separate page. This version does not include CRUD functionalities.

## Technical implementation:
